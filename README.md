Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

Description:
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++.

A BST is a non-linear data structure that stores elements in a hierarchical order where:
- The left child contains values less than the parent.
- The right child contains values greater than the parent.

This ensures efficient insertion,search,and deletion operations.


Features:
- Insert new nodes into the BST  
- Search for elements in the tree  
- Delete specific nodes while maintaining the BST property  
- Display the tree using inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals
